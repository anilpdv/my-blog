> content is most important thing in design, before you start. Having content eliminates most of the issues cause after.

### Something things to remember when writing content for the web.

-   Re - write pariahs in to bullet points.

example: we have this text here which description of this website [Home - Princess Anne Country Club](https://www.princessannecc.com)
